# Simple_Calculator

Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. Perform the calculation and display the result.

## Introduction
The calculator program is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program provides a simple yet effective solution for users who want to perform calculations in an interactive way using the command-line interface. Users are prompted to input two numbers and then choose an arithmetic operation to perform on those numbers. Based on their input, the program will calculate and display the result.

##### The primary features of the calculator code include:

1 User-Friendly Interaction: Users are prompted to enter the numbers and choose the operation they wish to perform.

2 Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3 Error Handling: The program ensures safe division, preventing division by zero errors.

4 Modular Design: Each operation is defined as a separate function to improve readability and maintainability.

This simple calculator is an excellent project for beginners learning Python, as it introduces key concepts such as input handling, conditional statements, and function-based design.
